# Using OCI to Build a Java Application

## Introduction


The goal of this Hands-on-Lab is to allow you to discover, on Oracle Cloud, some key features recently added to the Java platform.

To achieve this, you will use :

* Java SE 16, currently in 'Release Candidate' phase and slated to be released mid-March 2021.

* Helidon, a collection of Java libraries for writing microservices,

* the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

It is expected that you have Java knowledge and some basic Linux skills (ex. edit files). During this HoL, you will also use Maven and Git. The only thing you need on your side is an SSH client, a web browser, and a direct Internet connection.

You will use Helidon as it is easy, simple, and fast but obviously, all the Java features discussed in this HoL can be used with any framework supporting the latest version of Java.
